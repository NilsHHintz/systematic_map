#The files contain Endnote X8 files of literature search and selection process for the systematic map: Ecological impacts of photosynthetic light harvesting in changing #aquatic environments: A systematic   literature map

#References are sorted according to their search/objective. 
#Hereby groups 1,2,3 include all records from electronical search
#1a, 2a, 3a, include all records left after screening the titles (of 1,2,3)
#1b, 2b, 3b, include all records left after screening the abstracts (of 1a,2a,3a)
#1c, 2c, 3c, include all records after manual addition of articles.

#To access: Download entire repository as .zip, extract all files, open LightReview.enl (double-click).
#A installed version of Endnote (latest X8) is needed on your system. For dowloading Endnote follow https://endnote.com/downloads

#The Literature search is additionally exported from Endnote into Microsoft Excel.
#Within the Excel file (Literature_SystematicMap_HintzEtal.xlsx) all references are sorted sheetwise according to their objective or serch specification.
#The last sheets (ALL_inital ...) contain the whole list of identified records throughout the screening steps. 
#E.g., ALL_initital contains all records from all three objectives which where identified in the initial search (compare to 1a+2a+3a as in Endnote)
#The next sheet Individual_inital contains all the initally identified records but dublicate entries between the objectives where removed.
#And so forth.
